  abstract  = {A considerable amount of research has been carried out in harvesting the benefit of chaos theory in image encryption. However, there are not many schema that effectively maximize the advantages of Lorenz system. In this paper, we present one such image encryption algorithm that utilizes the Lorenz system for pixel manipulations. The schema employs a unique diffusion technique using Knight's tour and ensures a secure encryption with high key sensitivity. Various security checks such as histogram analysis, information entropy analysis and correlation analysis were carried out on the encrypted image. Simulation results prove that the algorithm gives excellent encryption parameters like information entropy and correlation coefficients along with the encrypted image being secure against commonly known attacks. The paper also compares the algorithm with other similar encryption methods.},
